This repo holds all the aws data engineering practices and general data pipeline tutorials I have done. This only holds the submodule mapping to the repos that contain the actual content to these projects.

[c4pe2022-tweets](https://github.com/shiyis/c4pe2022-tweets) is a github action tweet scraper that could run on a schedule determined by specifying with cron in the YAML workflow config file. 

[terraform-labs](https://github.com/shiyis/terraform-labs) data engineering schema config with terraform hcl.
